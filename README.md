# TennisAce
Linear Regression Model Project (Data provided by CodeCademy)

The goal is to create a linear regression model that predicts the outcome for a tennis player based on their playing habits. By analyzing and modeling the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) data, I will determine what it takes to be one of the best tennis players in the world.

The data is a .csv file. The Python libraries used for this project are Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn
